# I wrote this for Rails 3 beta 4 / Ruby 1.9.2-pre3.
# This is a VERY nasty patch for work arounding rack's Encoding::BINARY (ASCII-8BIT) rack.input issue.
# I don't know the RIGHT solution about the issue, but I have to fix:
#   Encoding::UndefinedConversionError ("\xE3" from ASCII-8BIT to UTF-8)
# Sometime in the future, I hope this is no use...
